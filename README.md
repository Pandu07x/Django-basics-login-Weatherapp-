# Django-basics-login-Weatherapp-



this repo has two django basic programs : Login and Weatherapp

in Login app , i used basic concepts of login and used cookies for accessing . storing data in mongodb

in weather app: i used requests module to call api data and display data in the template (template is basic cause my css sucks)

to start the project please open in your convient IDE and in terminal write python manage.py runserver and it will work, when u ignite the app mongodb databse will be created and it will store the data.
